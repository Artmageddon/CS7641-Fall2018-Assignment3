Assignment 3

To fully evaluate the project, please clone all source code from Github:
https://github.com/Artmageddon/CS7641-Fall2018-Assignment3

data.zip contains all data needed to run this project, consisting of four files for training & testing data for MNIST, along with two csv's for the Adult Dataset.

Once extracted, This project contains two Python files: MNIST.py and Adult.py

Run these separately to produce the results given in the report. 

The code uses Python 3 and Scikit-learn to implement the various clustering and dimensionality reduction. 

Each file contains the following sections: 
*Preparation: Loading the raw data into memory, and doing any required preparation
*Clustering
*Apply dimensionality reduction algorithms
*Reproduce clustering on the transformed data
*Rerun the neural network with the transformed
*Treat the clusters as new features
